 Pay Case Study
---
## Overview and Origin
Apple was founded on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. From 1977 through 2007,  focused on personal computers including the Apple II, Macintosh, iMac, and MacBook laptops. In 2001,  launched the iPod, which also coinsided with the launch of iTunes. On January 9, 2007, Apple changed its name from "Apple Computer, Inc.", to just "Apple, Inc". During that announcement, Steve Jobs, introduced the iPhone as a cellular phone, music player and personal computer in one device. In 2008,  the App Store in order to sell third party applications.

###  What is Pay and how it came about.
In 2013, Apple started to get involved in mobile payments by joining forces with Visa, Mastercard and American Express to replace the tranditional information-sharing transaction system with a single-use "token" system.

Apple Pay digitizes the payment information and uses two-factor authentication, such as, Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem was Apple attempting to solve.
Based upon an article in the **_The New York Times_** written by Jenna Wortham, Apple came up with the idea for Pay. 
![Mobile Wallet Article referenced during  keynote](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/technology/im-still-waiting-for-my-phone-to-become-my-wallet.html)

On September 11, 2014, during the iPhone 6 keynote. Apple introduced Pay. Eddy Cue demonstrated how Pay will work with the current version of iPhone, iPhone 6. A Near field communication (NFC) antenna was built into the iPhone 6 device to work with the current Touch ID and Secure Element that stores all of the credit card information within the Passbook app that is secure and private. When you upgraded to the new iPhone 6, you had the option of taking the payment information that was already stored in the customer's iTunes account, or you can add a credit or debit card using the camera app and would confirm with the financial institution that you are that cardholder. As a security feature, Pay doesn't store the credit card number on the iPhone or pass along the credit card number to the merchant. It creates a device only account number and stores the information within the secure element in the iPhone and provides a one time payment number and dynamic security code to the merchant. When you lost your iPhone you can suspend the card(s) saved on the device without having to replace your credit card. Also, as a privacy feature, Apple doesn't store your credit card information, the merchant you purchased from or the amount you spent. That information was only between the customer, the financial institution and the merchant.

Additionally, Pay can used to make purchases on websites that accept Pay and will use the information stored within Pay, such as address information, and provide the information to the online merchant.

Since the merchant doesn't see the credit card information whether during a point of sale transaction or online transaction, this increases the security of the payment transaction so that the credit card information can't be used fraudulently.

Now Pay can be used accross the other devices, such as Apple Watch, iPad, iMac, and Macbook

### Who was Pay intended to service
Pay was indended to be used by customers that owned an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer.
Google Wallet is Google's mobile payment. Both systems allow contactless payments using NFC technology.
However, Google Wallet uses a more traditional PIN based authentication system which allows for older mobile devices. 
The additional intended use is security and reduce credit card fraud. Both payment platforms doesn't share the customer's credit card information with the merchant reducing the chance of the credit card information falling into the wrong hands. Which in turn limits the financial institutions and/or merchants losses incurred from fraudulent transactions.
The one glaring difference between Google Wallet and Pay is Google tracks your transactions and will use that information accross all of the Google's platforms which is part fo the Goggle's business model. Apple expressly states that they do not track your transactions. This is way Apple is very attractive to customers that take their privacy very seriously.

## Business Landscape
### What domain of the financial industry
While companies like Apple and Google are technology companies that offer consumer electronics, they are now offering solutions in consumer banking industry. 
Apple's and Google's mobile payment platforms are challenging the financial institutions that offer consumer banking products to now offer contactless payment credit and debit cards as an alternative to Pay.
Additionally, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless payments have increased. According to a study conducted by Mastercard, 79% of its customers used contactless payment in 2020 and 74% will continue to utilize contactless payments going forward.

### How is Pay performing
With the benefits of mobile wallet systems, such as Pay, slowly people are moving towards using their smartphones and smart watches as a form of payment at everyday merchants.
Since the launch of Pay in 2014, Apple holds a 15% market share on mobile devices. It is estimated that 50% of online purchases were maded using a mobile device since 2014. Analyst estimate that 10% of all card transactions will be performed on Pay by 2025.
Pay is growing with both retailers and applications. Pay has outgrown PayPal by a 4 to 1 margin. ![Pay Trends 2020](https://www.hostmerchantservices.com/2020/09/apple-pay-trends-and-updates-fall-2020/)
![Pay Stats & Facts](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)
Currently Apple is the preferred mobile wallet provider at 13% compared to Goggle Wallet at 4% and Samsung at 3%. While traditional banks and credit card companies hold significant hold of marketshare, the increasing popularity of this payment method may offer advantages as a payment method.

Unfortunately, there are credit card fraud taking place. The responsibility of detecting credit card fraud still lies with the issuer. ![Apple Pay Fraud](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/03/27/millions-are-being-lost-to-apple-pay-fraudwill-apple-card-come-to-the-rescue/?sh=7b9b4029622f)

## Recommendations
With the increase in popularity with Pay, Apple should work with the credit card issuers on how best to confirm the identity of the card holder adding the credit card to Pay. So that the credit card is not able to be added to another Pay account, such as a form of two-factor authentication.
Additionaly, I would start discussions with the credit card issuers and financial institutions to see how we can assist merchants, especially, the small businesses on how we can help adopt more contactless payment systems that can not only work with Pay, but other mobile platforms. Additionally, I would see if there can be incentives for merchants to bring in mobile payments availability, such as Pay, by way of reducing the fees merchants incure when a customer uses a credit or debit card because of the increase in security that is offered by mobile payments. Unfortunately, there is always the possibility of fraud taking place, but continuing to work on methods of reducing credit card fraud.

In the end by reducing, and possibly eliminating, credit card fraud, the fees issuers charge merchants will help incentivise the adoption of mobile payments.
