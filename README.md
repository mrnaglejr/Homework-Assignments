---
## Overview and Origin

From 1977 through 2007,  focused on personal computers including the Appe II, Macintosh, iMac, and MacBook laptops. In 2001,  launched the iPod, which also coinsided with the launch of iTunes.

###  What is Pay and how it came about.
In 2013, Apple started to get involved in mobile payments by joining forces with Visa, Mastercard and American Express to replace the tranditional information-sharing transaction system with a single-use "token" system.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem was Apple attempting to solve.
Based upon and article in the **_The New York Times_** writting by Jenna Wortham, Apple came up with the idea for Pay.

On September 11, 2014, during the iPhone 6 keynote. Apple introduced Pay. Eddy Cue demonstrated how Pay will work with the current version of iPhone, iPhone 6. A Near field communication (NFC) antenna was built into the iPhone 6 device to work with the current Touch ID and Secure Element that stores all of the credit card information within the Passbook app that is secure and private. When you upgraded to the new iPhone 6, you had the option of taking the payment information that was already stored in the customer's iTunes account, or you can add a credit or debit card using the camera app and would confirm with the financial institution that you are that cardholder. As a security feature, Pay doesn't store the credit card number on the iPhone or pass along the credit card number to the merchant. It creates a device only account number and stores the information within the secure element in the iPhone and provides a one time payment number and dynamic security code to the merchant. When you lost your iPhone you can suspend the card(s) saved on the device without having to replace your credit card. Also, as a privacy feature, Apple doesn't store your credit card information, the merchant you purchased from or the amount you spent. That information was only between the customer, the financial institution and the merchant.

Additionally, Pay can used to make purchases on websites that accept Pay and will use the information stored within Pay, such as address information, and provide the information to the online merchant.

Since the merchant doesn't see the credit card information whether during a point of sale transaction or online transaction, this increases the security of the payment transaction so that the credit card information can't be used fraudulently.

Now Pay can be used accross the other devices, such as Apple Watch, iPad, iMac, and Macbook
