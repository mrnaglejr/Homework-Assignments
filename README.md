 Pay Case Study
---
## Overview and Origin


Apple was founded on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. From 1977 through 2007,  focused on personal computers including the Apple II, Macintosh, iMac, and MacBook laptops. In 2001,  launched the iPod, which also coincided with the launch of iTunes. On January 9, 2007, Apple changed its name from "Apple Computer, Inc." to just "Apple, Inc." During that announcement, Steve Jobs, introduced the iPhone as a cellular phone, music player and personal computer in one device. In 2008,  launched the App Store in order to sell third party applications.

### What is Pay and how it came about and what specific financial problem was Apple attempting to solve.

---
In 2013, Apple started to get involved in mobile payments by joining forces with Visa, Mastercard and American Express to replace the traditional information-sharing transaction system with a single-use "token" system. Apple Pay digitizes the payment information and uses two-factor authentication, such as, Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. On September 11, 2014, during the iPhone 6 keynote, Apple introduced Apple Wallet. 
Based upon an article in the **_The New York Times_** written by Jenna Wortham, Apple came up with the idea for Pay. 
On September 11, 2014, during the iPhone 6 keynote, Apple introduced Pay. Eddy Cue demonstrated how Pay will work with the current version of iPhone, iPhone 6. A Near field communication (NFC) antenna was built into the iPhone 6 device to work with the current Touch ID and Secure Element that stores all of the credit card information within the Passbook app that is secure and private. When you upgraded to the new iPhone 6, you had the option of taking the payment information that was already stored in the customer's iTunes account, or you can add a credit or debit card using the camera app and would confirm with the financial institution that you are that cardholder. As a security feature, Pay doesn't store the credit card number on the iPhone or pass along the credit card number to the merchant. It creates a device only account number and stores the information within the secure element in the iPhone and provides a one time payment number and dynamic security code to the merchant. When you lost your iPhone you can suspend the card(s) saved on the device without having to replace your credit card. Also, as a privacy feature, Apple doesn't store your credit card information, the merchant you purchased from or the amount you spent. That information was only between the customer, the financial institution and the merchant.

Additionally, Pay can used to make purchases on websites that accept Pay and will use the information stored within Pay, such as address information, and provide the information to the online merchant.

Since the merchant doesn't see the credit card information whether during a point of sale transaction or online transaction, this increases the security of the payment transaction so that the credit card information can't be used fraudulently.

Now Pay can be used across the other devices, such as Apple Watch, iPad, iMac, and MacBook

### Who was Pay intended to service


Pay was intended to be used by customers that owned an iPhone, iPad, and/or a Mac computer.
Google Wallet is Google's mobile payment. Both systems allow contactless payments using NFC technology.
However, Google Wallet uses a more traditional PIN based authentication system which allows for older mobile devices. 
The additional intended use is security and reduce credit card fraud. Both payment platforms doesn't share the customer's credit card information with the merchant reducing the chance of the credit card information falling into the wrong hands. Which in turn limits the financial institutions and/or merchants losses incurred from fraudulent transactions.
The one glaring difference between Google Wallet and Pay is Google tracks your transactions and will use that information across all of the Google's platforms which is part fo the Goggle's business model. Apple expressly states that they do not track your transactions. This is why Apple is very attractive to customers who take their privacy very seriously.

## Business Landscape
### What domain of the financial industry

While companies like Apple and Google are technology companies that offer consumer electronics, they are now offering solutions in consumer banking industry. 
Apple's and Google's mobile payment platforms are challenging the financial institutions that offer consumer banking products to now offer contactless payment credit and debit cards as an alternative to Pay.
Additionally, with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless payments have increased. According to a study conducted by Mastercard, 79% of its customers used contactless payment in 2020 and 74% will continue to utilize contactless payments going forward.

### How is Pay performing

With the benefits of mobile wallet systems, such as Pay, slowly people are moving towards using their smartphones and smart watches as a form of payment at everyday merchants.
Since the launch of Pay in 2014, Apple holds a 15% market share on mobile devices. It is estimated that 50% of online purchases were made using a mobile device since 2014. Analyst estimate that 10% of all card transactions will be performed on Pay by 2025.Pay is growing with both retailers and applications. Pay has outgrown PayPal by a 4 to 1 margin. 

Currently Apple is the preferred mobile wallet provider at 13% compared to Google Wallet at 4% and Samsung at 3%. While traditional banks and credit card companies hold significant hold of marketshare, the increasing popularity of this payment method may offer advantages as a payment method.

Unfortunately, there is credit card fraud taking place. Currently, the responsibility of detecting credit card fraud still lies with the issuer. Some banks have credit cards that are easier to add to Pay than other institutions. Apple send the same information to authorize the card to be added to Pay, however, each issuer intrepets the data differently. The largest issue is determing what level of risk vs the ease of customers being able to add their card(s) to Pay. Since the ability for bad players to obtain credit card and personal information need to confirm the customer's indenty can be easly obtained, unfortunately, credit cards can be added surreptitously without the customers knowledge until fraudlent transactions appear on their bank statement.
The biggest challenge is getting the banks to close these loopholes while trying to have the customer take additional steps that are need to add their card to Pay. Unfortunately, banks are weighing the need to limit the risk of fraud with the ease of adding a card to Pay.
While fraud is known issue, it won't stop the increased popularity and convenience of mobile payment technology. While customers are aware of the risk of fraud and privacy loss, the convenience will still outway those concerns.

## Recommendations

With the increase in popularity with Pay, Apple should work with the credit card issuers and financial institutions on how best to confirm the identity of the card holder so that by adding the credit card to Pay it is more secure. One such step they can undertake as a form of two-factor authentication. By sending a text message or email to the customer based upon the contact information that is already currently on file with the bank/credit card issuer, that way you can confirm the customer's identity. Another way to confirm the customer is having a code on the screen that can be entered on the bank or credit card issuers website.
Additionally, I would start discussions with the credit card issuers and financial institutions to see how we can assist merchants to adopt mobile payments as an accepted form of payment, especially, small businesses who will see the benefits of contactless payment systems. If moblie payments can demonstrate that they are more secure it might be an incentive for merchants to bring in mobile payments availability, such as Pay. Since mobile payments can show how secure they are it could possibly have an effect on the fees merchants incur they accept this type of payment because the risk of fraud will drop. 

In the end by reducing, and possibly eliminating, credit card fraud, the fees issuers charge merchants will help incentives the adoption of mobile payments. Unfortunately, there is always the possibility of fraud taking place, but continuing to have the right conversations and working together to reduce the risk will lead to a more cohesive relationship among all involved.  By making mobile payments more secure and a better incentive compared to traditional forms of credit card payments, both customers and merchants might be more encourged to adopt mobile payments.
